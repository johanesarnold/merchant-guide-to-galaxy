Requirements
1. Input to your program consists of lines of text detailing your notes on the conversion between
intergalactic units and roman numerals. You are expected to handle invalid queries
appropriately.
2. Basic components such as Input/Output processing and business logic core are essential. But
please design your application as complete and modular as possible, following a standard
software system requirements such as error handling, etc.
3. Well refactor the code to follow good code practices. (Some good relevant resources can be
found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Code)
4. Unit/Integration tests covering all the scenarios are good to have to show proper testing skills.
5. Implement your application using Java or Go.
6. Please document clearly about your system design solution (feel free to use professional
diagrams if you think necessary), nontrivial assumptions as well as the clear instructions on
compiling and invoking the program with program environment details. Proper server setup
instructions are also essential if you develop a web application for presenting the results.
